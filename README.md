# Web_Dev

The best way to learn JavaScript is to build projects. If you want to become a good web developer, you need to start creating projects as soon as possible. 
You can start by building beginner-level projects like a simple calculator, digital clock, or stopwatch.

You can make a simple calculator using just core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This calculator can perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features of the Calculator

In this project, you are going to develop a calculator that will have the following features:

It will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
It will perform decimal operations.
The calculator will display Infinity if you try to divide any number by zero.
It will not display any result in case of invalid expression. For example, 5++9 will not display anything.
Clear screen feature to clear the display screen anytime you want.

Components of the Calculator

The calculator consists of the following components:

Mathematical Operators: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

Digits and Decimal Button: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, . .

Display Screen: It displays the mathematical expression and the result.

Clear Screen Button: It clears all mathematical values.

Calculate button (=): It evaluates the mathematical expression and returns the result.

Folder Structure of the Calculator Project

Create a root folder that contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
You can name the files anything you want. 
Here the root folder is named Calculator. 
According to the standard naming convention, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are named index.html, styles.css, and script.js respectively.
